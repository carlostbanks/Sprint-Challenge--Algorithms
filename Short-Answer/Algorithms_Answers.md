#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
This algorithm runs on O(1) Constant Time. 


b)
This algorithm runs on O(n) Linear Time. 


c)
This algorithm runs on O(1) Constant Time.

## Exercise II

1 - Drop the egg from the middle floor. 
2 - If the returned value from the middle floor is "Egg Broke", move to the current floor minus one and try again until return is "Egg Not Broke"
3 - If the returned value from the middle floor is "Egg Not Broke", move to the current floor plus one until the return value is "Egg Broke"
4 - Once the returned value is "Egg Broke" move to the current floor minus one and return.

The runtime of the current implementation would be O(log n).
